      <title>About Tim Berners-Lee</title>
      <h1>Early life and education.</h1>
    </center>
    <ul>
      <li>Tim was born in london, England in 1955.</li>
      <li>His parents were Mary Lee-woods and Conway Berners-Lee.</li>
      <li>
        HIs parents worked on the first commercially-built computer, the
        Ferranti Mark Ⅰ.
      </li>
      <li>
        His primary education from Sheen Mount Primary School and London's
        independent Emanuel School.
      </li>
      <li>
        He studies at The Queen's College where he received his first-class
        degree in Physics in 1973.

    <h3>How he came to work at CERN.</h3>
    <p>
      Tim Berners-Lee joined CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear
      Research, in 1980 as an independent contractor. At CERN, he was tasked
      with helping manage the vast amount of data generated by the
      organization’s research. <br />
      <br />
      During this time, he developed a system called Enquire, which allowed
      scientists to share and retrieve information efficiently. Although he left
      CERN briefly, Berners-Lee returned in 1984 as a full-time employee.<br />
      <br />
      By then, CERN had become the largest internet node in Europe. Recognizing
      the challenges of sharing research and collaborating across a global
      network of scientists, Berners-Lee envisioned a system to simplify
      communication. <br />
      <br />
      This vision led to the development of the World Wide Web in 1989, based on
      concepts he had first explored with Enquire. In summary, his work at CERN
      provided both the inspiration and the practical environment to create the
      groundbreaking technologies that underpin the modern web.

    <h3> The Proposal for the World Wide Web (1989):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Berners-Lee wrote a proposal in March 1989 titled "Information Management: A Proposal", outlining a system for sharing and accessing information globally.
      </li>
      <li>
        His supervisor, Mike Sendall, famously described it as "vague but exciting."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Development of the Web Technologies (1990):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>By 1990, Berners-Lee had developed the key technologies for the World Wide Web:</li>
        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): To structure and display content.</li>
        <li>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): For communication between clients and servers.</li>
        <li>URL (Uniform Resource Locator): To uniquely identify resources on the web.</li>
        <li>Created the first web browser (WorldWideWeb) and first web server (httpd).</li>
    </ul>
